#I decided to include these charts in order to compare not only the change in mortality rates over time for
#These athletes, but also to show the differences in the trends over time between black and white players respectively. 
#By doing so, we are able to see how another factor such as race can play a role in determining the long term health 
#Of these athletes, and how it compares between the two races. It also raises the question whether or not it is the
#Race itself or other determining factors such as average household income and access to healthcare that are to blame for 
#the differences.
