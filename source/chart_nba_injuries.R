# The aim of this chart is to directly draw a correlation between NBA injuries
# and the effects on a player's career status from 2010 to 2018. In this chart, 
# the proportion of the top 10 most common NBA injuries is indicated for each of 
# the top 4 most common NBA career status caused by those injuries. 
# One noticeable observation could be drawn from the severity of the injury and 
# the career status. An example could be observed the bruised injuries happened more 
# frequently in less life impacting career status such as DNP (Did Not Play) and DTD 
# (Day To Day). Whereas, injuries involving surgery happened a lot more frequently 
# in life impacting or threatening career status such as out for season and out indefinitely.
