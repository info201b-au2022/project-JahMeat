            official records from the NBA that has been collected by the data science
            communities with similar goals as us. These data are utilized to inform
            medical practioners, NBA associations, and the public like you and me to
            better understand the seriousness of injuries in competitive sports in order
            to create better health plans and implement safety guidelines for these 
            passionate athletes.")

takeaway <- p("Each of these graphs address various takeaways. Firstly, the kinds of injuries
              that result in permanent, career ending damage. For example, surgery often leads to 
              players being out indefinitely. We can takeaway from this data the extent to which injuries are
              ending careers. For the most part, only surgery requiring injuries will damage a player for good.
              These kinds of injuries are relatively rare, implying that career ending injuries are rare. The 
              second takeaway our data gives is the extent to which under-age deaths occur in NBA players. Only 30
              players died under age 30 within our dataset. That being said, that is a very minimal 
              number of players. However, within those 30 players only 2 of them weighed above 110 kilograms,
              the other 28 below 110 kilograms. This implicates the possibility of weight being a factor in 
              death rates. Finally, the third takeaway from our data is that for the most part, the NBA does
              take proper protocol to ensure the safety of their players. All though injury is still common, 
              for the most part it is highly treatable.")
