## **Abstract**
The primary question being asked in this project is how sports injures in the NBA can affect a given player's career and thus the impact on their long term health by measurement of life expectancy. It is important to conduct research and analyze data about the well-beings of competitive sports players to push overall medical incentives for sports medicine development and attention to creating better health plans. We plan to address this question by conducting a thorough analysis on NBA players who have been reported to suffer some form of injuries or illness that affected their participation in their careers as well as effects on their life expectancy.

## **Introduction**
  Basketball has always been an essential part of American sports. The National Basketball Association, NBA, has always been part of the top 3 big sports organization in attaining an ever growing popularity amongst pop culture and promotion of brands and industries in the U.S. However, with that much monetization and public supports, risks in player safety and implications on health and wellness arise when it comes to contact sports like basketball. In the world of NBA, players suffering from physical minor injuries are quite common. To an extent, the types of injuries can vary in a broad spectrum of fatality, resulting in shortening of life or imminent death. NBA players deserve better medical treatments and services for the risk they are willing to take for entertainment and the positive economic impact in the U.S. By developing this project, we hope to incentivize medical research in sports medicine and push for better health plans for NBA players as well as other players in prevalent sports in the U.S.

## **Problem Domain**
#### Project framing
  Our project is framed to link datasets regarding NBA injuries, and their consequences together in order to gauge how likely certain injuries are to result in long term and career ending ailments. This knowledge is meant to be used to understand certain injuries and give insights on how to best approach these injuries to prevent long term damage.
#### Direct Stakeholders
  The overall issue we are planning to address with this project effects a variety of people. Direct stakeholders include past athletes, current athletes and future athletes at all competitive levels and not necessarily just the NBA. In the article "In that Instant It was Over" the author states that nearly a third of career athletes will experience a career - ending injury (Loberg, 2009). Many of the injuries that will be addressed in our project span not just basketball but various sports as well. Furthermore, team owners are also direct stakeholders. Knowing how best to approach certain injuries and knowing which injuries will take their players out for an extensive period of time is vital knowledge to maintaining a team.
#### Indirect Stakeholders  
  Indirect stakeholders include but are not limited to, medical practitioners, their patients, and other people whose health can be positively or negatively effected by any discoveries made in this research.
#### Human Values  
  As humans we all value our health. According to John Hopkins Medicine, sports and recreational activity are responsible for nearly 21% of traumatic brain injuries among American children (2019). Clearly, by becoming an athlete one is putting their physical health at risk. Researching and understanding how certain injuries effect an athlete's career and long - term health can help point towards the direction treatments need to go in order to mitigate the damage of certain injuries.
#### Harms and Benefits
  The benefits of this project come from the insights that can be drawn from analyzing and understanding how certain sports injuries effect people in the long term. The harms however, lie in the fact that the NBA consists of mostly males. Male and female anatomy are different in a many ways, meaning certain injuries that effect a male may effect a female differently. Since this research is limited to tracking NBA injuries, this could be of harm to female athletes. For example, due to women having about 52% of the average upper body-strength of a male, females often receive more sports-related injuries than males (Gombera, 2020).
