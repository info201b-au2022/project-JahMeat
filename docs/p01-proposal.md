## **Abstract**
  The primary question of our project is how injures in the NBA affect a given player's career and thus questionability on their long term health. We plan to address this issue by researching and analyzing data regarding individual players injuries, types of injuries, and impact on player career status. 

## **Introduction**
  The primary goal of this project is to extract information on NBA injuries to their career status to address the lack of data and notions on sports injury treatments released on the web to the public.
