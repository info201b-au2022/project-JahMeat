## **Abstract**
  The primary question of our project is how injures in the NBA effect a given player's health in the long term, which is of importance because of the trend of decline in an athlete's physical health post retirement. We plan to address this issue by researching and analyzing data regarding common injuries in the sport, and how they effect a player of an extended period of time. The primary concern is identifying and healing the primary injuries that effect an athletes post retirement health, which we will address by understanding what the common injuries are and how they are treated.
