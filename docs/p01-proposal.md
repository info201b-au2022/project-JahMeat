## **Abstract**
  The primary question of our project is how injures in the NBA affect a given player's career and thus questionability on their long term health. We plan to address this issue by researching and analyzing data regarding individual players injuries, types of injuries, and impact on player career status.

## **Introduction**
  The primary goal of this project is to extract information on NBA injuries to their career status to address the lack of data and notions on sports injury treatments released on the web to the public.
































## **Problem Domain**
#### Project framing
  Our project is framed to link datasets regarding NBA injuries, and their consequences together in order to gauge how likely certain injuries are to result in long term and career ending ailments. This knowledge is meant to be used to understand certain injuries and give insights on how to best approach these injuries to prevent long term damage.
#### Direct Stakeholders
  The overall issue we are planning to address with this project effects a variety of people. Direct stakeholders include past athletes, current athletes and future athletes at all competitive levels and not necessarily just the NBA. In the article "In that Instant It was Over" the author states that nearly a third of career athletes will experience a career - ending injury (Loberg, 2009). Many of the injuries that will be addressed in our project span not just basketball but various sports as well. Furthermore, team owners are also direct stakeholders. Knowing how best to approach certain injuries and knowing which injuries will take their players out for an extensive period of time is vital knowledge to maintaining a team.
#### Indirect Stakeholders  
  Indirect stakeholders include but are not limited to, medical practitioners, their patients, and other people whose health can be positively or negatively effected by any discoveries made in this research.
#### Human Values  
  As humans we all value our health. According to John Hopkins Medicine, sports and recreational activity are responsible for nearly 21% of traumatic brain injuries among American children (2019). Clearly, by becoming an athlete one is putting their physical health at risk. Researching and understanding how certain injuries effect an athlete's career and long - term health can help point towards the direction treatments need to go in order to mitigate the damage of certain injuries.
#### Harms and Benefits
  The benefits of this project come from the insights that can be drawn from analyzing and understanding how certain sports injuries effect people in the long term. The harms however, lie in the fact that the NBA consists of mostly males. Male and female anatomy are different in a many ways, meaning certain injuries that effect a male may effect a female differently. Since this research is limited to tracking NBA injuries, this could be of harm to female athletes.
